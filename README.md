# Hi there, I'm Ian 👋

I'm a Javascript developer who is passionate about writing code, solving problems, and continuous learning. Right now, I'm immersing myself in an exciting startup culture, where I get to contribute to a product that I believe in and feel the thrill of every small win.

## 🤝 How to reach me

Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:ianduhamelhayes@gmail.com) if you want to talk about tech, startups, or just to say hi. I'm always open for a chat!

## 🎯 Fun fact

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the gym or reading a good book.
