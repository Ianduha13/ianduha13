# Hello, World! I'm Ian 👋

A Javascript developer with a passion for crafting code, unraveling complex problems, and never-ending learning. These days, I'm immersed in the thrilling world of startups, injecting my energy and creativity into a product I truly believe in.

Beyond the binary, I find joy in strengthening the ties within the developer community. Sharing knowledge, insights, and experiences is my way of giving back to this remarkable tech universe.

When the screens go dark, you'll find me flexing at the gym or diving into a compelling book.
